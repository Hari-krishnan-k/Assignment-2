<h1>Computer</h1> 
<hr>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    A computer is a machine that uses electronics to input, process, store, and output data. Data is information such as numbers, words, and lists. Input of data means to read information from a keyboard, a storage device like a hard drive, or a sensor. The computer processes or changes the data by following the instructions in software programs. A computer program is a list of instructions the computer has to perform. Programs usually perform mathematical calculations, modify data, or move it around. The data is then saved on a storage device, shown on a display, or sent to another computer. Computers can be connected together to form a network such as the internet, allowing the computers to communicate with each other.

    The processor of a computer is made from integrated circuits (chips) that contains many transistors. Most computers are digital, which means that they represent information using binary digits, or bits. Computers come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the brand, model, and purpose. They range from small computers, such as smartphones and laptops, to large computers, such as supercomputers.

<h1>Characteristics</h1> 
<hr>
    <ul>
       
        <li>The two things make it a computer are that it responds to a specific instruction set in a well-defined manner, and that it can execute a stored list of instructions called a program. There are four main actions in a computer: inputting, storing, outputting and processing.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Modern computers can do billions of calculations in a second. Being able to calculate many times per second allows modern computers to multi-task, which means they can do many different tasks at the same time. Computers do many different jobs where automation is useful. Some examples are controlling traffic lights, vehicles, security systems, washing machines and digital televisions.</li>
       <br>
        <li>Computers can be designed to do almost anything with information. Computers are used to control large and small machines that, in the past, were controlled by humans. Most people have a personal computer at home or at work. They are used for things such as calculation, listening to music, reading an article, writing, or playing games.</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Hardware</h1> 
    <hr>
    <p>
        Modern computers are electronic computer hardware. They do mathematical arithmetic very quickly, but computers do not really "think." They only follow the instructions in their software programs. The software uses the hardware when the user gives it instructions and produces useful outputs.
    </p>
<br>
    <h1>Controls</h1> 
    <hr>
    <p>
        Computers are controlled with user interfaces. Input devices which include keyboards, computer mice, buttons, and touch screens, etc.    </p>
        <h1>Generations of Computers</h1>
        <Hr></Hr>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>First Generation (1940s-1950s):</strong> The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II, using electromechanical and thermionic valve technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Second Generation (1950s-1960s):</strong> The invention of the transistor in the late 1940s marked the beginning of the second generation. These computers were smaller, faster, and more reliable than their predecessors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Third Generation (1960s-1970s):</strong> The development of integrated circuits in the late 1950s led to the third generation of computers. These computers were even more powerful and compact.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fourth Generation (1970s-present):</strong> The invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s sparked the fourth generation. This generation is characterized by the use of microprocessors and the development of personal computers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond):</strong> The fifth generation focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning. These computers are designed to understand natural language and mimic human reasoning.
